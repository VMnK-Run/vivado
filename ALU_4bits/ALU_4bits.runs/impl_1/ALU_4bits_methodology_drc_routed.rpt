2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net sys_clk_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): sys_clk_IBUF_inst/O
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell alu1/OF_reg_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) alu1/OF_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell alu1/ZF_reg_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) alu1/ZF_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
